This repository contains the slides and code from the joint Cville Data Science &amp; PyCHO December 2015 meet up.

**For the YelpDemo notebook to work as written,** you'll need to download the Yelp Dataset and place the *yelp_dataset_challenge_academic_dataset* directory in the notebook's project folder. The dataset can be found on the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/" target="_blank">Yelp Dataset Challenge</a> page.
